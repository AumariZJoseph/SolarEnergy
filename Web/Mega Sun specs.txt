Features:
1)

High heat effectiveness: higher than all-glass evacuated solar collector tube by 15%
The tube structure is between all-glass evacuated tube and metal-glass evacuated tube with heat pipes

2)

Heat pipe conduction: successfully prevents the defects of tube breakage and low power output caused by water fouling and
deposits or dust and sand. Suitable for frigid zones because there is no water in the tube.

3)

Prevents the tube from being easily broken caused by volume expansion when temperature is excessively high especially in
long dry seasons. Suitable for the harsh tropical climates because no water is in the tube

4)

Designed for pressure system, when low thermal capacity the tube starts up quickly, energy output is within only two minutes
of sunshine

5)

Heat pipe material: TP2 copper. The heat collecting part is a vacuum glass tube that lowers heat loss.

6)

Insulation temperature can reach 250º C, average heat efficiency can still be more than 50%; even under -50 o C

7)

High efficient selective absorptive coatings and vacuum heat insulation technology ensure the tube has higher heat output in
cloudy weather and in moist areas, especially on long rainy days. Stable solar conversion throughout the day, with the rounded
shaped tube allowing solar penetration from all angles

Special Features:
1) High efficiency, rapid warming. Heat pipe in vacuum tube could transfer hot energy to cold water in pressurized water tank rapidly.
2) The whole pressure of the system is up to 1.5kg/M2, the inlet could connect the tap water directly, the max pressure can be 0.7Mpa
3) No water in the tube, one tube broken don't influence the system working
4) The design for inner tank is reasonable and scientific, which could hold 100,000 times fatigue test without any damage.
5) Able to be used in all climates
6) Easy to install on the roof or ground
